This is the source code for a short 90s intro-style ad for a dubtechno (music) event taking place in [Sofia, Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia).

The video is done with pipeline of tools. You can consult assets/export for the takes and the progress.

It is based on the wonderful https://github.com/johnnyfreekanz/terminaltexteffects

Render font: is IBM Plex Mono, Rendered in alacritty, captured with windows 11 screencapture.

The result is processed with crt_royale and one of the slang shaders. The combination was lost shortly after.

The brightness is then corrected with crt_royale, cause CRT shaders are a bit dark on purpose

The result is muxed in avidemux with KANZ's track 'Luminal Spaces', and further cropped and retouched.

ASCII Fonts: DiamFont, Crawford2, and perhaps another one ...
